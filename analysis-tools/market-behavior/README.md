## Key Concepts

### Investor vs Position Dynamics
- **Same investors, more positions** = Accumulation (bullish)
- **More investors, fewer positions** = Distribution (rotation)
- **Both increasing** = Strong momentum
- **Both decreasing** = Bearish sentiment

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Core holders adding** = High conviction in existing investors
- **Profit taking** = Early investors selling to new entrants
- **Growing & accumulating** = Both new adoption and accumulation
- **Exodus & selling** = Coordinated exit

## Use Cases

- **Market sentiment analysis**: Is the market bullish or defensive?
- **Smart money tracking**: What are elite investors doing differently?
- **Rotation detection**: Which sectors are gaining/losing favor?
- **Timing analysis**: Are we in accumulation or distribution phase?
