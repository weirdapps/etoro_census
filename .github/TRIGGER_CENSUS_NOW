Manual census generation request: 2025-06-02 16:45:00 UTC

IMPORTANT FIXES INCLUDED IN THIS GENERATION:
1. ✅ Color-coded return values (green/red/blue badges)
2. ✅ Fixed missing returns for major instruments in top 1000/1500 bands
3. ✅ Optimized API calls (no more duplicate price fetching)
4. ✅ All closing price data saved to JSON export

Expected improvements:
- Consistent return values across all tabs (100, 500, 1000, 1500)
- Proper color coding matching % OF PIs column style
- Faster generation due to optimized API usage
- Complete price data in JSON for future analysis
